## Essential Google Cloud Infrastructure: Core Services

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)
It is a way of identifying who can do what on which resource. The who can be a person, group or application. The what refers to specific privileges or actions and the resource could be any Google Cloud service.

#### Organization
**Organization roles:** ```organization admin``` (control over all resource), ```project creator``` (controls project creation and who can create it).
##### Resource manager roles
- **Organization**
    - Admin (full control over resource)
    - Viewer (view access to all resource)
- **Folder**
    - Admin (full control over folders)
    - Creator (browse hierarchy and create folders)
    - Viewer (view folders and projects)
- **Project**
    - Creator (create or migrate projects)
    - Deleter (delete projects)

### Roles
There are three types of roles in Cloud IAM: 
- ```Basic roles``` (apply across all services in a project) ```owner``` ```editor``` ```viewer``` ```billing admin```
- ```Predefined roles``` (apply to a specific resource in a project) ```InstanceAdminRole``` -> ```compute.instance.(get,list,delete,start,stop,setMachineType)``` list of permission bundled together.
- ```Custom roles``` (lets you define which permission to add) Not update automatically when google updates something...

### Members
which define the who part of who can do what on which resource. There are five different types of members, Google accounts, service accounts, Google Groups, Google Workspace domains, and Cloud Identity domains.

#### Service accounts
A service account is an account that belongs to your application instead of an individual end user. When you run code that is hosted in Google Cloud, you specify an account that that code should run as.

#### Google groups
A Google Group is a named collection of Google accounts and service accounts. Every group has a unique e-mail address that is associated with that group. Google Groups are a convenient way to apply an access policy to a collection of users.

#### Google Workspace domains
A Workspace domain represents a virtual group of all the Google accounts that have been created in an organization's workspace account. Workspace domains represent your organization's Internet domain name, such as Example.com. And when you add a user to your Workspace domain, a new Google account is created for the user inside of this virtual group, such as username@example.com.

#### Cloud Identity
Cloud Identity lets you manage users and groups using Google Admin console.

### IAM Policy
- A policy contains a ```list of bindings```.
- A binding binds a ```list of members to a role```.
- where the members can be ```user accounts, Google Groups, Google Domains, and service accounts```. 

#### Cloud Directory Sync
What if you already have a different corporate directory? How can you get your users and groups into Google Cloud? Using Google Cloud Directory Sync, your administrators can log in and manage Google Cloud resources using the same username and passwords that they already use. This tool synchronizes users and groups from your existing active directory or LDAP system with users and groups in your Cloud Identity domain. The synchronization is one-way only, which means that no information in your active directory or LDAP map is modified.

### Service Accounts
- A service account is an account that belongs to your ```application``` instead of to an individual end user.
- Provides an identity for carrying out ```server-to-server``` interactions in a project **without** supplying user credentials.

**Example:** ```service-account-name@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com``` </br>
By default, all projects come with a built-in Compute Engine default service account. Apart from the default service account, all projects come with a Google Cloud APIs service account, identifiable by the email project-number@cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com. This is an account designed specifically to run internal Google processes on your behalf and is automatically granted the ```Editor``` role on the project. 

</br>

**There are three types of service accounts:**
- user-created or custom
- built-in (Compute Engine and App Engine service account)
- Google APIs service accounts (Runs internal google processes on your behalf)

### Cloud Storage
- Cloud storage is Google Cloud's object storage service.
- Object storage for companies of all sizes. Store any amount of data. Retrieve it as often as you’d like.
- Immutable and ```object versioning``` ( a new version is made with every change ) 
- **Access Control Lists** (ACLs) = scope + permissions
- **Lifecycle policies** (delete when you want)
- **Advantages:**
  - Unlimited storage
  - Worldwide accessibility (geo-redundancy)
  - Low latency and high durability.
  - **HTTPS/TLS** security on server-side

#### Types of storage classes: 
- [Standard Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes#standard): Good for “hot” data that’s accessed frequently, including websites, streaming videos, and mobile apps.
- [Nearline Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes#nearline): Low cost. Good for data that can be stored for at least 30 days, including data backup and long-tail multimedia content.
- [Coldline Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes#coldline): Very low cost. Good for data that can be stored for at least 90 days, including disaster recovery.
- [Archive Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes#archive): Lowest cost. Good for data that can be stored for at least 365 days, including regulatory archives.

### Filestore
Filestore is a managed file storage service for applications that require a file system interface and a shared file system for data.
- Fully managed network attatched storage (NAS) for compute engine and GKE instances.
- Predictable performance,
- Full NFSV3 support.
- Scales to 100s of TBs for high performance workloads.
